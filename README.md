# Very Simple Music Player

## Basic Info:

This is very simple music player. I made it because of the 2 reasons:
* I was bored
* I wanted to work with the HTML Audio API

I think that this project solved these problems.

## Features:
Since it is simple player, there are nothing fancy in it, just the basics.

* Track current position control via track bar
* Play/Pause track contol
* Volume contol via volume bar
* Track current positon control via the button on the left/right side of the play/pause button

## What I used:
Again, nothing fancy: no additonal libraries (hello, jQuery), no frameworks. Just plain and vanilla JavaScript

* HTML5, CSS3
* Materialize UI framework
* Vanilla JavaScript
